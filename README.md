# Lab 8 - Starter
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, because it prevents from building onto
a corrupted code, which means that if the code pushed is not working correctly and has issues that
tests won't allow to pass, without constant automated checks, it would be hard to acknowledge the
mistake and new pushes would be builded onto the mistake, which ruins the whole project. Also small
and constant fixes are always more fitting than big giant fixes to prevent big mistakes.

2. No

3. No, message is too big for unit test, it is not fitting, some part of message could be tested but not the whole message itself

4. yes, because max message length is a part of the whole application, for example you can test after typing in
more than 80 characters or test to see if it is correctly catching up with character count. The test is possible
unlike question number 3.
